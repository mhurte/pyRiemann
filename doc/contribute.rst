Contributing to PyRiemann
=========================

PyRiemann is an open-source library and anyone is free to access and suggest improvements to the code.

We use github to track issues and feature requests : https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann




Bug reports
----------------

If you witness a bug and wish to submit an issue on github, first verify that it has not been solved or is already being adressed.

In order to fasten the corrections of bugs, it is recommended that bug reports contain the following informations :

- Your operating system type and version aswell as your python version
- The PyRiemann version you are currently using
- A short code snippet that will trigger the issue
- A description of the problem
- The full console traceback in case an error is raised



Pull Requests 
------------------

For contributing and involving yourself in the project, you can check in the "Issue" tab on github (https://github.com/pyRiemann/pyRiemann/issues) and try to answer a bug report or a feature request.

If you believe that you can add or improve either a feature, or simply correct typos or improve the documentations, you can also make a pull request that will be reviewed and possibly implemented if it fits the library's needs.

In any case, it is higly recommended to make sure that your code is easy to understand, readable, and well documented.

Before any submission, we strongly encourage you to run the library's tests beforehand by running pytest locally, to ensure your contribution is working properly with what was already implemented with the following command line: 
``python -m pytest tests/``
